# Diamonds price prediction 
here you can find the notebook for predictions on diamonds prices also you can find the .csv in this repo or you can get it from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds).

## Regression Models
The regression models used in this notebook are the following:
- SVR
- Random Forest
- Decision tree
- XGBoost
## Metrics used for evaluation
The metrics used for evaluate the models listed above are:
- MSE
- MAE
- RMSE
- R-squared

I have written a medium article discussing in detail this topics [here](https://medium.com/@ivanjarquincort/lets-talk-about-metrics-mse-mae-rmse-r-squared-337e49557ae7).

## Conclusions
Based on our analysis, I can conclude that the features x, y, z, and carat are the most relevant for the prediction and XGBoost is the most eficient model for prediction that I used in this data. You can find more details in the .ipynb file
